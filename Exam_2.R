        In this model, the first coefficient represents the intercept, and the second coefficient 
        repesents the slope. Generally, the intercept can be interpreted as the predicted HP value at
        Speed = 0 for some Pokemon. Additionally, the slope can be interpreted as: for a one unit increase in Speed,
        a Pokemon is predicted to have 'Coefficient 2' more HP, holding all else constant. In the context of this
        data and estimated model, a Pokemon with no speed is predicted to have an HP of approximately 58. And, for
        a one unit increase in speed, a Pokemon is predicted to have around 0.15 more HP, all else equal. While this
        estimate may be precise and highly statistically significant, it is fairly small. To get a sense for the effect,
        for a Pokemon with a somewhat average speed of 75, this Pokemon is predicted to have an HP of about 70. 
        This finding is consistent with the idea that a Pokemon with a higher Speed is probably well rounded in statistics
        for most other variables (e.g. defense, attack, etc.).")),
